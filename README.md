# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
Where pollution has become a major problem around the world, air pollution is the most dangerous, shocking and severe pollution among other pollutions e.g. water pollution, soil pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, thermal pollution etc. Air pollution is the major cause of diseases like asthma, cancer, bronchitis, birth defects and immune system like diseases. This system implements the combination of an android app, server, gas sensors (CO2, CO, LPG, and CH4) to sense the air quality of the environment and shows the real condition of air. Solving the draw backs of existing air quality sensors this device can be used to monitor various gasses at a time. The most demanding thing would be this system will give the real time data and will show the quality of the air based on the standard air quality. The system will give the user the indication of the air quality and based on given parameters it will let the user know how much the environmental air is polluted or safe. The goal is to make the system as reasonable as possible so that people from every society background can use this and if some research organization wants to do further research then if some nominal amount of money is invested then it would be a great solution to install a weather station thus air quality monitoring system.
